## Website Structure & What To Know to Contribute

Our website is built using the following technologies. I highly suggest you learn about or at least get a feel for:

- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS, SCSS** for styling
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** for interactivity
- **Angular Service** for Dynamic Website Modification and Deployment

To get started, set up your development environment using the [Installation Guide](./INSTALL.md) and once you are ready to contribute, see the [Development Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for details.
