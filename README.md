# CODERS - Website Research Project

Welcome to the CODERS Club Website GitHub repository! This website serves as the central hub for our vibrant community of coding enthusiasts at our college.

## Website Structure & What To Know to Contribute:

Nothing! Our website is built using the following technologies
I highly suggest you learn about or at least get a feel for:

- HTML for structure
- CSS, SCSS for styling
- JavaScript/TypeScript for interactivity
- Angular Service for Dynamic Website Modification and Deployment

# Cool Angular Tips and Tricks

# CODERS_Website

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
